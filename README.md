Hey there,

I've developed this webpage using React with typescript and tailwind css. I've avoided using big state management libraries as a middleware between the view and the data layer. That was mainly because the business logic revolving around this webpage is not that complicated. I am looking forward to discussing my decision making process, cheers.
